# unconstrained-Optimization-Classical-Methods-Search-and-Gradient
This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts that implement some of the classical optimization methods for unconstrained optimization models: Steepest-Descent, Newton method, Gauss-Newton, Conjugate Gradient method, Fibonacci search, Golden-section search, Dichotomous search and Exhaustive search.
